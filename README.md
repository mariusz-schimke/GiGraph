------

A simple solution for generating graphs in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)" target="_blank">DOT language</a>. The output generated by this library is a textual script that can be visualized and/or converted to an image with the help of external tools. A handy one is a plugin for <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>, named <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EFanZh.graphviz-preview" target="_blank">Graphviz Preview</a> (you will need to install <a href="https://www.graphviz.org/download" target="_blank">Graphviz</a> as well). There are also online tools like <a href="http://www.webgraphviz.com" target="_blank">WebGraphviz</a>, where you can paste the generated script to view your graph.

# Intro

### Building blocks

There are three basic types that are the building blocks of a graph:

- **DotGraph** - the *root* graph itself,
- **DotNode** - a node of the graph,
- **DotEdge** - an edge that connects two nodes (or more, when subgraphs are used).

When necessary, **subgraphs** can be used as well, and there are two types of them:

- **DotSubgraph** - groups nodes together *logically* and allows you to control their layout against other nodes in the graph,
- **DotCluster** - a special type of subgraph that groups nodes together *visually* by placing them inside a rectangle.



### Attributes

Each individual element described above may have **attributes** specified, like background color, style, node shape, arrow head shape and so on. You don't have to specify them, however, and if you don't, the visualizing tool will use its own style defaults for rendering them.

```csharp
myElement.Attributes.Label = "This is a label";
```



### Default attributes

The root graph and the subgraphs allow you to set **global defaults** for all nodes and/or edges within them, so that you don't have to set them individually for every element they contain.

```csharp
myGraph.NodeDefaults.Color = Color.Yellow;
```

```csharp
myGraph.EdgeDefaults.Color = Color.Red;
```



## Graph

There are two types of graphs:

- **directed** (the edges are presented as arrows),
- **undirected** (the edges are presented as lines).

Graph contains nodes and edges, and may optionally have some attributes set, that determine its style, layout etc.

```csharp
myGraph.IsDirected = true;
```

When you want to forbid creating multi-edges, use the *IsStrict* property. In strict graphs there can be at most one edge with a given tail node and head node in the directed case.

```csharp
myGraph.IsStrict = true;
```



## Node

Nodes are distinguished by their **textual identifiers**. The identifiers are used by edges to refer to a head and a tail node that they connect. If you don't specify a **label** attribute for a node, the identifier will be used as a label when visualized.

```csharp
myGraph.Nodes.Add("MyNode1", node =>
{
    node.Attributes.Label = "Hello World!";
    node.Attributes.Shape = DotShape.Hexagon;
});
```



## Edge

Edges **connect two nodes** by referring to their identifiers. Edges may also **connect two subgraphs** or **a single node with a subgraph** (or the other way round). In both these cases such connection is interpreted as a many-to-many or a one-to-many connection respectively, between the nodes within the subgraphs or between the single node, and the nodes in the subgraph.

Note that **a node does not necessarily have to be added to the nodes collection** of the graph or subgraph when it is referenced by an edge (as long as there is no need to specify any attributes for the node for instance).

```csharp
myGraph.Edges.Add("MyNode1", "MyNode2");
```
