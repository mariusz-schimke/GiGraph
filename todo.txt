Road map:
1. Gradually add support for all available attributes.
2. String types (escString, html, record).
3. Remove redundant IEnumerable<> overloads to leave only params [].
4. Verify the validity of XML documentations.

Other (always valid): 
1. Check if methods are coherently marked as virtual.
2. Check if interfaces should be extracted for any classes.
3. Check if properties should or shouldn't have setters.
4. Some attributes are settable only on specified elements, but it turns out that the documentation is not always right.

Nice-to-haves:
1. Implement predefined HTML nodes (shape = none, margin = 0): https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html#polygon.
2. Text justification markers support (\l, \r) and others like \N, \E etc.
3. Record nodes.
4. Double list (doubleList) attribute type (and other types, even if not supported directly).
5. Comments assigned to nodes, edges, graph, subgraphs, clusters, and statement attributes, rendered above these elements. Generation options for comment style (// or /* */)? NOTE! Single-line output cannot have // comments!
