Road map:
1. Gradually add support for all available attributes (headclip, tailclip, image, imagepath etc., rotate, truecolor, pack, packmode).
2. Verify the validity of XML documentations.

Other (always valid): 
1. Check if methods are coherently marked as virtual.
2. Check if interfaces should be extracted for any classes.
3. Check if properties should or shouldn't have setters.
4. Some attributes are settable only on specified elements, but it turns out that the documentation is not always right.

Nice-to-haves:
1. Implement predefined HTML nodes: https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html#polygon.
2. Text justification markers support (\l, \r) and others like \N, \E etc.
4. Double list (doubleList) attribute type (and other types, even if not supported directly).
