Road map:
1. Support color list.
2. Gradually add support for all available attributes.

Other (always valid): 
1. Check if methods are coherently marked as virtual.
2. Check if interfaces should be extracted for any classes.

Nice-to-haves:
1. Implement predefined HTML nodes (shape = none, margin = 0): https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html#polygon.
2. Text justification markers support (\l, \r) and others like \N, \E etc.
3. Record nodes.
