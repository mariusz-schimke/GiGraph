Road map:
1. Support subgraphs in edge chains.
2. Add port support for nodes connected with edges (equivalent to tailport/headport edge attributes, but these attributes are shared between all nodes in an edge chain, so port should be implemented as well for individual nodes of an edge).
3. Support color list.
4. Gradually add support for all available attributes.

Other (always valid): 
1. Check if methods are coherently marked as virtual.
2. Check if interfaces should be extracted for any classes.

Nice-to-haves:
1. Implement predefined HTML nodes (shape = none, margin = 0): https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html#polygon.
