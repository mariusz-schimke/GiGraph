    <summary>Simple yet versatile library for generating graphs in the DOT language.</summary>
    
    <description>A simple solution for generating graphs in the DOT language. The output is a textual script that can be visualized and/or converted to an image with external tools. A handy one is a plugin for Visual Studio Code, named Graphviz Preview. There are also online tools like www.webgraphviz.com, where you can paste the script to view your graph.</description>
    
    <releaseNotes>
      1. Node port support added. It enables setting which side of a node an edge head and/or tail is attached to.
      2. Added methods to edge, node, subgraph, and cluster collections to simplify adding new elements.
      3. The collection of subgraphs has been split in two separate collections (Subgraphs, Clusters).
      4. Added support for node groups (in the DOT script they are rendered as a list of nodes with a shared list of attributes).
      5. Added support for edge sequences (in the DOT script they are rendered as a sequence of nodes and edges with a shared list of attributes; subgraphs in the sequence are supported too).
      6. Added support for endpoints embedded in subgraphs. This facilitates generating edges joining one node to multiple nodes, multiple nodes to one node, or multiple nodes to multiple nodes.
      7. The elements of the DOT script can optionally be sorted now by setting an appropriate flag in the DOT generation options (disabled by default).
      8. Refactoring.
