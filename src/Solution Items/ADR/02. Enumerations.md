# 02. Enumerations

Date: 2021-09-19

## Context

Members of enumerations that represent DOT attribute values are annotated with C# attributes that assign them a string value. This document defines the rules for that.

There are two types of C# attributes to use depending on the use context of an enumeration:

1. DotAttributeValue(*string*)
2. DotHtmlAttributeValue(*string*)

## Decision

1. Every enumeration member has to have an attribute of the same type assigned coherently. They may have both attributes assigned if the enumeration is used in both contexts.
2. For flags enumerations annotated with the *DotHtmlJoinableType* attribute, extra members that represent masks composed of multiple flags of the same enumeration should not have an attribute assigned. They are not considered to represent standalone values, but rather a collection of flags, each of which will have its own attribute value assigned according to rule 1 above.
3. An empty string as an attribute value is not allowed. If a an enumeration member is supposed to produce an empty value, *null* should be used instead.
