# 04. Attribute Property Source Generator

**Date:** 2025-02-22

## Context

The graph and all its elements expose properties that are mapped to DOT attribute keys. Since all property implementations follow the same pattern, there is a significant amount of boilerplate code. Additionally, the library allows the use of lambda expressions to get or set attributes and retrieve attribute mappings as metadata. Consequently, all these properties are annotated with the `DotAttributeKey` attribute. This setup enables automatic property body generation, as the DOT key is explicitly known for each property.

## Decision

1. All partial properties annotated with the `DotAttributeKey` attribute are automatically defined by a dedicated source generator.
2. All properties representing DOT attributes should be auto-generated unless an exception applies (e.g., explicit interface implementations).
3. Unit tests ensure the correctness of these properties by covering multiple test scenarios:
   - Verify that the property is settable and returns the same value as assigned.
   - Ensure that the property correctly assigns an attribute with a key matching the one specified in its annotation.
   - Confirm that all properties maintain the correct attribute key, even when overridden in inheritance. This is validated using a snapshot file containing a graph script where the graph includes all supported elements, and each element (including the graph itself) contains all its supported attributes.

## Consequences

1. The amount of boilerplate code is significantly reduced.
2. The risk of inconsistencies between getter and setter keys or between a property and its attribute key is mitigated.
